# To-Do-List-App-

Welcome to **My To-Do List App**, your friendly companion to getting things done! — built with ❤️ using **React Native** and **Expo Go**.

## What’s this app about?

It’s a simple, clean, and super functional To-Do list that helps you organize your day, one task at a time. No fluff, just your tasks in a beautifully smooth experience.

## Why this app?

Because managing your tasks should feel natural and rewarding, so I put some thought into making the UI satisfying with feedback using animations.  
You’ll notice those animations throughout — from smooth screen transitions to interactive feedback — all crafted to boost your UX and keep you engaged while you check off your goals.
